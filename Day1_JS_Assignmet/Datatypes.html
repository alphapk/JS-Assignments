    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>"Data types basically specify what kind of data can be stored and manipulated within a program.

    There are six basic data types in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories: 
    primitive (or primary), 
    composite (or reference), 
    special data types. 
    
    String, Number, and Boolean are primitive data types. 
    Object, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) are composite data types. 
    Whereas Undefined and Null are special data types.
    
    Primitive data types can hold only one value at a time, whereas composite data types can hold collections of values and more complex entities."</p>
